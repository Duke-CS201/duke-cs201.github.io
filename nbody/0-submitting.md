The only file you need to submit is NBody.java. If for some reason you create other classes NBody depends on (this is neither necessary nor recommended), submit those as well.

Make sure when you submit, all of the following are present and functional:

<code>
Class: NBody<br>
&nbsp;Method: public double distance(double, double, double, double)<br>
&nbsp;Method: public double force(double, double, double)<br>
&nbsp;Method: public double[][] positions(Scanner, int, int)<br>
</code>

You also must submit your README in order to receive any credit.
