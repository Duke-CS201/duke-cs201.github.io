Welcome to Boggle.

Welcome to the page for the Boggle assignment. The goal of this assignment is to practice recursive backtracking, to empirically analyze your code and resulting data, and to compare the performence of algorithms.

Before we get started, we need the starting skeleton code. It's is available through Snarf (using [Ambient](https://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/ambient/)), as well as the course webpage.

[Here](/boggle/printer-friendly) is a printer friendly version of this assignment.

Do not be scared by the number of classes! You will not use many, as they are for making a functional GUI. In this assignment you will:

1. Create the class **GoodWordOnBoardFinder**to find possible words on a BoggleBoard.
2. Implement and Benchmark different lexicons. 
3. Implement BoardFirstAutoPlayer and compare it with LexiconFirstAutoPlayer.
4. Analyze runtimes and tradeoffs in different implementations. 

Good luck!
