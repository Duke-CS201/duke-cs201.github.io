Welcome to Huffman, your final programming assignment. It will be imperative that you have an understanding of the concepts before you code. READ THE ENTIRE ASSIGNMENT BEFORE YOU START TO CODE. Create helper methods to reduce reduncy in code. 

We cannot stress enough how important it is to develop your program a few steps at a time. At each step, you should have a functioning program, although it may not do everything the first time it's run. By developing in stages, you may find it easier to isolate bugs and you will be more likely to get a program working faster. In other words, do not write hundreds of lines of code before compiling and testing

Before we get started, we need the starting skeleton code. It's is available through Snarf (using [Ambient](https://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/ambient/)), as well as the course webpage.

This is a partner project. When submitting, please only submit one project, but include both net-ids in your **README.txt**.

##Background

This coding assignment was developed in the mid 90s for use at Duke, and has many adoptions in similar courses elsewhere. [Huff-Old](http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/poop/huff/info/) is a complete description of an older version of the assignment. It may be useful in understanding the assignment, as it provides detailed examples. 

There are many techniques used to compress digital data. This assignment covers the Huffman coding algorithm. Several algorithms for data compression have been patented, e.g., to use the MP3 codec to compress audio (which uses Huffman encoding as one of the steps in the algorithm). 

Huffman coding was invented by David Huffman while he was a graduate student at MIT in 1950 when given the option of a term paper or a final exam. For details see [this 1991 Scientific American Article](http://www.huffmancoding.com/my-uncle/scientific-american). 

In this assignment you'll implement a complete program to compress and uncompress data using Huffman coding. Refer to notes from class, previous readings, and recitation to make sure you are familiar with Huffman encoding.
