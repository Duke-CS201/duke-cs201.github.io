Answer the following questions in just a couple of sentences.  No need to write a whole paper.  Just give a definitive answer and a little empirical data to back it up if necessary.

1. Devise another way to store the header so that the Huffman tree can be recreated (note: you do not have to store the tree directly, just whatever information you need to build the same tree again).
2. Do text files or binary (image) files compress more (compare the calgary (text) and waterloo (image) folders)?  Explain why.
3. How much additional compression can you achieve by compressing an already compressed file?
4. Can a file be designed that can be compressed a lot potentially over multiple compressions?
