<ul>
<p>Your analysis should contain:</p>
<li>Data, explanation of process, and explanation of results for <code>SimpleStrand.cutAndSplice</code>. In particular, you should generate data to display O(N) behaviour where N is the size of the recombined strand returned. For this, just run the DNABenchmark as given to you and put your data into README. Explain why O(N) makes sense. Record your results in Analysis. </li>
<li>Data, explanation of process, and explanation of results for longest string and time for both 512M and 1024M heap-size. In your analysis, comment on whether you can fit in the next power-of-two string into 1024M after 512M and comment on the timing. (Did the time increase for the last entry? If so, by how much? You can change the memory size to 2048M and 4096M to do an even better analysis) Describe how you determined the power-of-two string you can use in both memory sizes, what it is, and the amount of time it took. For this section, the value which we'll care about is when the program crashes due to the heap space error.</li>
<li>Data, explanation of process, and explanation of results for the virtual experiments ran for LinkStrand, including your conclusion and explanation of O(B) time complexity where B is the number of breaks. The instructions for this step is given clearly and concisely in Benchmarking Part 2.</li>
</ul>

<b> So, it should contain everything from the sections (and the subsections) labeled Benchmarking Part 1 and Benchmarking Part 2. Read it carefully. </b></font>
