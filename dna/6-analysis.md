<ul>
<p>Your analysis should contain:</p>
<li>Data, explanation of process, and explanation of results for <code>SimpleStrand.cutAndSplice</code>. In particular, you should generate data to display O(N) behaviour where N is the size of the recombined strand returned. Explain why O(N) makes sense. Record your results in Analysis. </li>
<li>Data, explanation of process, and explanation of results for longest string and time for both 512M and 1024M heap-size. In your analysis, comment on whether you can fit in the next power-of-two string into 1024M after 512M and comment on the timing. Describe how you determined the power-of-two string you can use in both memory sizes, what it is, and the amount of time it took.</li>
<li>Data, explanation of process, and explanation of results for the virtual experiments ran for LinkStrand, including your conclusion and explanation of O(B) time complexity.</li>
</ul>
